# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **White Temple Website** project - a new repository that is currently being set up. As this is a website project, it will likely involve web technologies and may include both frontend and backend components.

## Development Workflow

Since this is a new repository with no commits yet, the first steps will involve:

1. **Project Initialization**: Setting up the basic project structure and configuration files
2. **Technology Stack Selection**: Choosing appropriate web technologies (React, Vue, Angular, static site generators, etc.)
3. **Development Environment Setup**: Configuring build tools, package managers, and development servers

## Common Commands

*Note: These commands will be updated as the project structure is established*

### Git Operations
```powershell
# Initial setup
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Standard workflow
git status
git add <files>
git commit -m "<message>"
git push
```

### Future Development Commands
Once the technology stack is chosen, this section will include:
- Build commands
- Test commands
- Linting and formatting
- Development server startup
- Deployment commands

## Architecture Notes

*This section will be populated as the codebase develops*

The architecture and structure will depend on the chosen technology stack. Common patterns for website projects include:

- **Static Site**: Simple HTML/CSS/JS or static site generator
- **SPA (Single Page Application)**: React, Vue, or Angular with build tools
- **Full-Stack**: Frontend + backend API with database
- **JAMstack**: Static site with API services and headless CMS

## Project-Specific Guidelines

*To be added as development practices are established*

## Environment Setup

*To be documented once dependencies and environment requirements are determined*
